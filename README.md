# Execd

Execution enforcement for founders. Not a task manager.

`Platform: Windows · macOS`  
`Stack: Electron · React · TypeScript · SQLite`  
`Status: Beta`

## What This Is

Execd is a local-first desktop app that turns monthly goals into daily execution. It converts goals into AI-generated subgoals, then into scoped daily tasks based on your real working hours. It enforces execution with an always-on overlay, proof-required task completion, and strict end-of-day scoring. This is not a habit tracker or a to-do app. It is an enforcement system.

## How It Works

Monthly Goals -> AI Subgoals -> Daily Tasks -> Lock Plan -> Execute with Proof -> End Day Score -> AI Feedback -> Repeat

## Features

- 5 monthly goals (3 business, 1 personal, 1 family) — fixed structure for focused execution.
- AI validation and subgoal expansion — goals are checked and broken into concrete deliverables.
- Daily task generation scoped to working hours — plans fit your available time.
- Plan lock — tasks freeze, execution begins — no mid-day reshuffling.
- Proof of completion required (comment or link) — completion claims need evidence.
- Always-on-top overlay with live task status — execution state stays visible while you work.
- Hourly system notifications — periodic prompts to check progress.
- Carry-over system (max 2 tasks) — forces prioritization and limits spillover.
- Execution score (weighted by effort) — performance reflects task difficulty.
- Brutal AI end-of-day feedback — direct analysis of misses and patterns.
- Daily report with image export — capture and share day summary.
- Weekly, monthly, and yearly reports — multi-level performance visibility.
- Analytics with AI pattern diagnosis — charted trends plus AI interpretation.
- Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama (local, free), OpenRouter — choose cloud or local models.

## Download

Pre-built installers are available on the [Releases page](../../releases).

| Platform | File                    |
| -------- | ----------------------- |
| Windows  | `Execd-Setup-x.x.x.exe` |
| macOS    | `Execd-x.x.x.dmg`       |

Download the file for your platform, run the installer, and launch Execd.
No Node.js or technical setup required.

## Run From Source

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or higher
- npm

### Start in Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YagneshKhamar/execd.git
cd execd
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Build for Distribution

```bash
npm run build        # current platform
npm run build:win    # Windows installer
npm run build:mac    # macOS DMG
```

Output goes to the `dist/` folder.

## First Run

1. Setup screen — enter AI provider and API key (or configure Ollama for free local AI).
2. Goals screen — define 5 monthly goals, AI validates and expands each into subgoals.
3. Today screen — generate daily tasks, lock your plan.
4. Execute tasks with proof, end the day, get feedback.
5. Overlay stays on screen while you work.

| ------------------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| OpenAI (gpt-4o-mini)     | Pay per use (~$0.01/day typical) | API key from platform.openai.com                  |
| Anthropic (claude-haiku) | Pay per use (~$0.01/day typical) | API key from console.anthropic.com                |
| Ollama                   | Free, runs locally               | Install from ollama.com, run `ollama pull llama3` |
| OpenRouter               | Free tier available              | API key from openrouter.ai                        |

Recommended for most users: Ollama (free, private, no API key).  
Recommended if you want best AI quality: OpenAI gpt-4o-mini.

## AI Provider Notes

**OpenRouter reasoning models** (DeepSeek R1, Nemotron 3 Super, Qwen3 thinking
variants) return internal reasoning wrapped in `<think>` tags before the JSON
response. This can cause JSON parse errors in the app.

If you hit this issue, either:

- Switch to a non-reasoning model (Llama 3.3 70B, Mistral Small, DeepSeek V3)
- Or add this line to `callAI()` in `src/main/ipc/ai.ipc.ts`:
  `raw = raw.replace(/<think>[\s\S]*?<\/think>/g, '').trim()`

## Philosophy

Most founders do not fail because they cannot plan. They fail because nothing enforces execution once the plan exists. Execd is built to close that gap between planning and doing, day after day. No motivational language, no streak systems for vanity, no gamification loop. Proof or it did not happen.
